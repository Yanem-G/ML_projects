Machine Learning Projects Portfolio

Organized collection of my ML projects , I’ve worked on to explore and deepen my understanding of ML concepts .

# Projects:

# 1. Titanic Survival Prediction
First ML project — a beginner-friendly classification project implemented in Python using scikit-learn and RandomForestClassifier.The goal is to predict passenger survival based on features such as Pclass, Sex, Age, Fare, SibSp, and Embarked.

# 2. House Prices Prediction
Regression project that predict the sales price for each house using Advanced regression techniques like random forest and gradient boosting.

- Dataset: [House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques | Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques)

# 3. Cat vs Dog Classification
A deep learning project using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transfer Learning (with VGG16) to classify images of cats and dogs.

##  Notes
- You can download them directly from the Kaggle links provided above.
- Consider running deep learning projects in Google Colab with GPU support enabled.

##  Stay Tuned
More projects will be added as I continue to learn and experiment!
